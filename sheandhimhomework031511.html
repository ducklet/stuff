                <i>Photo by Sam Jones</i>
              </p>
              <p>Some people seem to be good at everything. It can be annoying. But when it comes to actress, songwriter, singer, and burgeoning origami artist
              (explanation below)&#160;Zooey&#160;Deschanel, it's
              not so grating. Whether starring in movies like 
              <i>(500) Days of Summer</i>or partnering with M. Ward
              for their retro-pop project She &amp;
              Him,&#160;Deschanel&#160;exudes a modest likability.
              Even though she's got every right to show off,
              she&#160;doesn't.</p>
              <p>This carried through to a recent interview
              with&#160;Deschanel&#160;and Ward in a downtown
              Manhattan hotel. The duo sat a few feet away from the
              hotel's main entrance, with a small divider offering
              some privacy from foot traffic and the front desk.
              Talking about their sophomore album,&#160; 
              <i>Volume Two</i>, both&#160;Deschanel&#160;and Ward
              were warm, deferential, and kinda nerdy-- they're not
              scared to drop music-geek references or discuss some
              of the jazz chords used to shade their subtly
              sophisticated songs.</p>
              <p>Since&#160;Deschanel&#160;writes the songs and
              sings for She &amp; Him, she did most of the talking,
              with Ward happy to support her answers and add some
              wry commentary along the way. In the following chat,
              we talked about Master P, Joni Mitchell's beret, and
              playing&#160;mouth&#160;trumpet.</p>
              <p>
              <b>Pitchfork:</b>Was there a moment while making or
              touring behind&#160; 
              <i>Volume One</i>where you guys thought, "This is
              something I could do for a while?"</p>
              <p>M. Ward: I knew it could be a long-lasting thing
              after first hearing&#160;Zooey's demos because she
              had much more than one record's worth of material,
              and the quality of the songs was so great.</p>
              <p>Zooey&#160;Deschanel: And I have so much respect
              for Matt. As long as he will work with me, I will
              work with him.</p>
              <p>MW: This is where we fist bump. [ 
              <i>Zooey&#160;and Matt bump fists</i>.]&#160;There's
              at least one fist bump every interview.</p>
              <p>ZD: There might be two, we don't know. But yeah,
              when I send a demo MP3 to Matt he'll always come up
              with production ideas that I never would have thought
              of in a million years. It's really fun to watch the
              songs blossom and unfold. Blossoming and unfolding
              are basically the same thing, but blossoming is more
              romantic,&#160;wouldn't you agree? [ 
              <i>laughs</i>]</p>
              <p>MW: Blossoming is more floral.</p>
              <p>ZD: Yeah, unfolding is more...</p>
              <p>
              <b>Pitchfork:</b>...like origami.</p>
              <p>ZD: Yeah. I finally figured out how to read
              origami directions. Have you ever tried to do it?</p>
              <p>MW: I know the dotted line means fold.</p>
              <p>ZD: Yeah, and then there are these dotted line
              arrows and you're like, "What the hell does that
              mean?" But, after staring at origami directions long
              enough, you sort of become one with them and start
              understanding them from the inside [ 
              <i>laughs</i>].</p>
              <p>
              <b>Pitchfork:</b>What did you make?</p>
              <p>ZD: I&#160; 
              <i>think</i>I made a zebra.</p>
              <p>MW: Did it have four legs?</p>
              <p>ZD: Yeah! It could stand up.</p>
              <p>MW: Was it black and white?</p>
              <p>ZD: Yes.</p>
              <p>MW: Oh yeah, it was a zebra.</p>
              <p>
              <b>Pitchfork:</b>Are there any examples of songs on
              the new album that you wrote one way and then it
              turned into something else after working on it with
              Matt?</p>
              <p>ZD: For "In the Sun", I originally composed it
              with a classic jazz chord progression-- with a little
              chromatic step-- and it was slower. But we got in the
              studio and Matt was like, "Why don't we put a Bee
              Gees beat on it?" And it totally came to life in a
              way I&#160;didn't expect.</p>
              <p>MW: We were able to use those same chords, but
              it&#160;doesn't sound like jazz, it just sounds rich.
              People like Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, and
              Johnny&#160;Marr&#160;are geniuses at bringing in
              those major seventh and sixth and ninth chords in
              different ways.</p>
              <p>ZD: I love a sixth chord. It's fun to take things
              from Gershwin and Cole Porter-- something a little
              more complex-- and make it sound like pop music.
              There are a million examples of not feeling the jazz,
              but&#160; 
              <i>using</i>the jazz. [ 
              <i>laughs</i>] Carole King does it a lot.</p>
              <p>Joni Mitchell's later records are like jazz.
              I've&#160;been watching a lot of Joni Mitchell
              YouTube clips and I can't believe her transformation
              from this folk singer in Canada. We found these
              really early videos of her, and it's like she's in a
              Disney movie she's smiling so much. And then you
              compare that to something like&#160; 
              <i>Blue</i>, where she's really depressed.&#160;And
              then later with her beret. [ 
              <i>laughs</i>] Her look matches what she's feeling.
              That's why it's fun to watch her.</p>
              <p>
              <b>Pitchfork:</b>When you guys are in the studio, do
              you bring each other records to use as
              references?</p>
              <p>ZD: Yeah. Whenever I buy a record I like, I will
              send a copy or at least a couple songs to Matt
              because we have very similar taste and it makes our
              language even more fluent.</p>
              <p>MW: That's a big part of the
              collaboration.&#160;Zooey&#160;turned me onto Darlene
              Love, Connie Francis-- a lot of female singers.</p>
              <p>ZD: You gave me that&#160;NRBQ&#160;record and
              that first Yo La&#160;Tengo&#160;record, which I
              freaking love.</p>
              <p>
              <b>Pitchfork:</b>Zooey, when listening to your lyrics
              I sometimes feel like a big sister is giving me
              advice. Would you say that's part of your
              personality?</p>
              <p>ZD: [ 
              <i>laughs</i>] I like that. But I think it's more me
              giving advice to myself, actually. I'll have these
              internal moments where I'm empathizing with someone
              else or feeling something myself, but I'm like, "How
              can I see the best in this situation?" Sometimes
              those are the moments where you can have the most
              clarity. Like, "What would I tell myself if I were
              someone else?" or, "How would I feel if I were this
              person?" I think I have some sort of transferring
              empathy-- I get a lot of inspiration from that.</p>
              <p>MW: Well said.</p>
              <p>
              <b>Pitchfork:</b>I'm curious about the genesis of the
              last song on&#160; 
              <i>Volume Two</i>, "If You Can't Sleep", which is
              pretty much 
              <i>a&#160;cappella</i>.</p>
              <p>ZD: I originally recorded that song with ukulele
              and a bunch of harmonies and then I just muted the
              ukulele and was like, "Oh, that sounds good." I'll
              write and make chords with my voice sometimes if I
              don't have an instrument even though it takes a
              million times longer [ 
              <i>laughs</i>].</p>
              <p>Then I sent it to Matt as an 
              <i>a&#160;cappella</i>demo and we just did more
              harmonies. I don't like to plan harmonies too much,
              because there's something fun that happens when you
              just sing a pass, then sing another pass, and layer
              them on top of each other. All of a sudden
              you've&#160;got all these parts. We were talking a
              lot about the Beach Boys and how they triple their
              vocals, so I was like, "Every line has to be
              tripled." It was exhausting, but fun.</p>
              <p>
              <b>Pitchfork:</b>The song "Sing"-- which references
              the show "Cribs" and a "gold-plated ceiling"-- stood
              out to me because a lot of your songwriting has this
              timeless quality...</p>
              <p>ZD: ...and that's the only one that has lyrics
              that are specific to today, right. That was an older
              song and I was like, "I can't keep a song with these
              lyrics on the record."</p>
              <p>MW: I had to push for that song to get on the
              album.</p>
              <p>ZD: I wrote that song while I was playing guitar
              in the middle of the night in London. Master P was on
              "MTV Cribs" and he had a gold plated-ceiling, I was
              like, "What?!" A lot of people are like, "Oh, this
              song must be about some dude." But it's more about
              myself than anything. It's about watching TV in the
              middle of the night. At that time, I was holed up in
              this apartment-- I was a recluse [ 
              <i>laughs</i>], I'm not gonna lie.</p>
              <p>
              <b>Pitchfork:</b>Why do you have an aversion to more
              contemporary songwriting styles and references?</p>
              <p>ZD: I dunno. "Sing" is just slightly out of my
              comfort zone, but I think that's good. There are
              definitely things that were on the first record--
              like the mouth trumpet solo on "This Is Not a Test"--
              that I was like, "I don't know. You can't have a
              mouth trumpet solo." But I trust Matt and look to him
              for advice, and he was like, "I think the mouth
              trumpet is awesome."</p>
              <p>MW: I&#160;wasn't in the control room saying, "How
              'bout a mouth trumpet." She came up with it on her
              own, and I just opened the door.</p>
              <p>ZD: And now I'm psyched that there's a mouth
              trumpet on that song.</p>
              <p>MW: It might be the first song ever to have a good
              mouth trumpet solo.</p>
              <p>
              <b>Pitchfork:</b>Are there a lot of mouth trumpet
              solos out there?</p>
              <p>MW: Bobby&#160;McFerrin&#160;might have dabbled in
              it.</p>
              <p>ZD: In my mind, there's a Beatles song with a
              mouth trumpet on it.</p>

<p><pre>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
<q>'Tis some visitor,</q> I muttered, tapping at my chamber door -
<q>Only this, and nothing more.</q></pre></p>

<p><pre>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore -
Nameless here for evermore.</pre></p>

<p><pre>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
<q>'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -
This it is, and nothing more.</q></pre></p>

<p><pre>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
<q>Sir,</q> said I, <q>or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you</q> - here I opened wide the door; -
Darkness there, and nothing more.</pre></p>

<p><pre>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, <q>Lenore!</q>
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, <q>Lenore!</q>
Merely this and nothing more.</pre></p>

<p><pre>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
<q>Surely,</q> said I, <q>surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -
'Tis the wind and nothing more!</q></pre></p>

<p><pre>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</pre></p>

<p><pre>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
<q>Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,</q> I said, <q>art sure no craven.
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!</q>
Quoth the raven, <q>Nevermore.</q></pre></p>

<p><pre>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -
Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as `Nevermore.'</pre></p>

<p><pre>But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -
Till I scarcely more than muttered <q>Other friends have flown before -
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.</q>
Then the bird said, <q>Nevermore.</q></pre></p>

<p><pre>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
<q>Doubtless,</q> said I, <q>what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of "Never-nevermore."</q></pre></p>

<p><pre>But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking <q>Nevermore.</q></pre></p>

<p><pre>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
<em>She</em> shall press, ah, nevermore!</pre></p>

<p><pre>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
<q>Wretch,</q> I cried, <q>thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee
Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!</q>
Quoth the raven, <q>Nevermore.</q></pre></p>

<p><pre><q>Prophet!</q> said I, <q>thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -
On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -
Is there - <em>is</em> there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!</q>
Quoth the raven, <q>Nevermore.</q></pre></p>

<p><pre><q>Prophet!</q> said I, <q>thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore -
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Lenore?</q>
Quoth the raven, <q>Nevermore.</q></pre></p>

<p><pre><q>Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!</q> I shrieked upstarting -
<q>Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!</q>
Quoth the raven, <q>Nevermore.</q></pre></p>

<p><pre>And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted - nevermore!</pre></p>
